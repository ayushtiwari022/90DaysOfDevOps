Hey Folks , As I have started 90daysofdevops challenge , this is my first day and I would like to highlight the basic concept of devops.
So DevOps is a process used to IT industry in which the development and the operations team work together in order to achieve their goal and develop a product.
In the implementation of Devops process there are three main components which are automation , scaling and infrastructure. These components help teams to achieve their goal and make the product more scalable and less prone to human errors.
Today DevOps is really important as it just not reduces time and efforts but also provide much better and robust product or application which save lots of capital as well.
